# Pintos
This repo contains skeleton code for CE Operating System course at Sharif University.

[Pintos](http://pintos-os.org) is a teaching operating system for 32-bit x86, challenging but not overwhelming, small
but realistic enough to understand OS in depth (it can run on x86 machine and simulators 
including QEMU, Bochs and VMWare Player!). The main source code, documentation and assignments 
are developed by Ben Pfaff and others from Stanford (refer to its [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).
